# Monster-Fight-Game


## Description
A simple game where you have to defeat a monster. 
With each of your blows, the monster delivers its own. 
There is an opportunity to be treated, but the monster will not wait for you, but will strike. 
There is a possibility of a strong blow, but be prepared - the monster will respond harder. 
Hits and healing have partially random power stats, as part of game balance. 
Initially, the monster is stronger than the player, which means that in addition to pressing the buttons, you also need a mind :)
A simple game written with Javascript, the Vue library, using HTML and CSS.
This is my first project on Vue, 
which was mandatory on the development path towards full-stack development
In the first version, the project has only Ukrainian localization, since this project is my implementation of work for the university.
In the future, the project will be translated into English and other languages.

## Future updates
- This project will likely receive updates as I progress as a front-end developer.
It is also possible that the project will have a backend. 
In the future, the project will be rewritten under the component architecture
